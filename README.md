#**Project 1 Submission in CarND-Term1** 
This repository contains project 1 submission in Self-Driving Car Nano-Degree, Term 1. The main task of this project is to find lane lines on the road in the example video streams, and output the annotated video with solid lane marks. the files are listed below.
##### 1. P1_report.md, project writeup 
##### 2. P1_code.ipynb, finalized project code, which takes the example video and output an annotated video
##### 3. CarNano_T1_P1.ipynb, code for testing/debugging use, which take image as input and output annotated image with lane marks. Various interim images after every processing pipeline step can be viewed
##### 4. yellow_output.mp4, annotated video for 'solidYellowLeft.mp4'
##### 5. white_output.mp4, annotated video for 'solidWhiteRight.mp4'
##### 6. challenge_output.mp4, annotated video for 'challenge.mp4'
##### 7. test_images/, image examples used for code debugging and verification
##### 8. image_results/, interim images from every detection pipeline step
